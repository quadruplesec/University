x5 = 0xFFFFFFFF = (1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111)2
x6 = (0011 1111 1111 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000)2

Assembly:
    bge  x5,  x6,  L1 # <- if x5 >= (2s complement) x6: L1, else: L2
    beq  x0,  x0,  L2 
L1: addi x6,  x6,  2  # <- x6 = x6 + 2
L2: ....  

A: "bge x5, x6, L1" compares x5 and x6 (in 2s complement.)
Since x5 is negative and x6 is positive, the jump to L1 does not occur (x5 is not greater or equal to x6), and the next instruction (if 0 = 0, jump to L2) makes the jump to L2.
Therefore, x6 has the same value at the end of the execution of these instructions.
